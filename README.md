# Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction

In this repository, different clustering and dimensionality reduction methods are tested and evaluated.

In the used dataset (tripadvisor_review.csv), travellerâ€™s average feedback/rating information on 10 different categories of attraction is given. In the first part of the jupyter notebook, the optimal number of traveller groups based on their attraction ratings is determined. Susbsequently, the relation between the individual features is computed and dimensionality reduction is performed. In the third part, component factor- and projection-based dimensionality reduction is applied. Finally, different clustering techniques are tested on an easy example.
